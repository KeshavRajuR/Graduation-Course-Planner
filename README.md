# Graduation-Course-Planner
This is a project where we use topologic sorting to decide the order in which a student should take up the courses in order to able to complete all.
For example C is a pre-requisite for Data Structure.
Data Structures is a pre-requisite for Algorithms.
So we will show the order C-> Data Structures -> Algorithms.
